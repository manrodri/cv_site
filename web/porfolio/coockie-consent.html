    <h2 class="section__title section__title-content">Cookies Policy</h2>
    <p>We use a system of classifying the different types of cookies which we use on the website, or which may be used by third parties through our website. The classification was developed by the International Chamber of Commerce UK and explains more about which cookies we use, why we use them, and the functionality you will lose if you decide you don’t want to have them on your device.</p>
    <div class="consent__item">
        <p class="conset__item-titl3">What is a cookie?</p>
        <p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your personal computer, mobile or other device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device.</p>
        <p>The reason we use cookies at manrodri devops is because we want to understand how people use our website so we can make it better</p>
    </div>
    <div class="consent__item">
        <p class="conset__item-titl3">How long are cookies stored for?</p>
        <p><strong>Persistent cookies </strong> – These cookies remain on a user’s device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.</p>
        <p><strong>Session cookies</strong>  – these cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.</p>
        <p>Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience.</p>
